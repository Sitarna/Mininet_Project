QoS Template: Y 

From PING: 
Average latency: 9.05 ms
Ping packet loss: 0.00% 

From IPERF3 (UDP stream):
Goodput: 0.00 Mbps
UDP Jitter: 0.00 ms
UDP Packet Loss: 0.00%
SLA compliance: Does NOT comply with your SLA rules 

Your target: latency <= 150 ms, jitter <= 50 ms, loss <= 1.0%, goodput >= 2.0 Mbps
Your result:  latency=9.05 ms, jitter=0.00 ms, loss=0.00%, goodput=0.00 Mbps
